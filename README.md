This is an adaptation of the Apache CouchDB project's config application. It's
provides an easy way to consume a well known .ini format inside Erlang to make
it easy to fit within existing infrastructure.

It should be noted that this application does not bend over backward to be OTP
compliant and as such should not be considered a replacement for application
environments. It's more of a simple addition for things which need live
configuration changes.
